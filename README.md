The goal of this website was to create a fully functional, responsive, administrative dashboard to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
operations on patient data and appointments that are all stored within the session storage. DiceBearâ€™s avatar API was also used to assign each
patient a different svg profile icon.
